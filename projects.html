	<p>Trail Quail is a  web application for hiking and biking trails, built on the xAMP stack and born in the CNM STEMulus Deep
		Dive Coding Bootcamp. Trail Quail makes the city of Albuquerque's Open Trails database accessible to the general
		public by importing the Open Trails .csv and .geojson files into a MySQL database which is then accessed through PHP and HTML.
		The trails are displayed on a map using the google maps api and ng-map. In addition to the previous mentioned functionality,
		Trail Quail allows for crowdsourcing of update trail information, which can then be imported into the City of
		Albuquerque's Open Trails Database.
