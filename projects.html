	<p>Trail Quail is a  web application for hiking and biking, built on the xAMP stack and born in the CNM STEMulus Deep
		Dive Coding Bootcamp. Trail Quail makes the city of Albuquerque's Open Trails database accessible to the general public by importing the Open Trails .csv and .geojson files into a MySQL database and which is then accessible through PHP and HTML. The trails are displayed on a map using the google maps api and ng-maps.   </p>
